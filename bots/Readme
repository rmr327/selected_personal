The purpose of this project was to automatically request to pick up work shifts based on the user's 
calender (google calender) schedule. The groupme script listens to a specified chat, and responds to messages
signifying someone is trying to drop their shift. If the shift being dropped meets user provided parameters
(such as time left to shift, or availability), the bot send a message back to the GroupMe chat, stating the 
user can pick up the shift. The shift_picker scripts listens to changes in the HTML content of the shift picking
website (WhentoWork). If a change is detected, and a shift is available that meets the user requirements, the
shift is picked up.

This program was made to save unnessary time wasted in aquiring on-campus work shifts.
